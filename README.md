# [Project 1: UVI Transfers 2019-2021](https://github.com/gondiam/visualization_timeseries)
* Using highcharter library we develop a time-series visualization of UVI transfers of a region of Spain 
* It is an interactive way between periods and more than 20 bases
* A summary of different parameters per each base
* A boxplot to visualize the distribution of the records of transfers in general and per year
* Total number of transfers per year and base

# [Project 2: Churn customers prediction](https://github.com/gondiam/Churn_prediction)
* A Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to understand the data and to compare betwwen groups of population
* Comparing by graphs the two groups was performed too in case it was a real variable was performed a density and boxplot graph otherwise was performed a barplot
* The resampling and feature engineering was important due to the imbalance dataset
* At the end we use a XGboost model for classification and using gridsearch we improve the hyperparameter tune to improve the performance
