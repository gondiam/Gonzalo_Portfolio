# [Project 1: UVI Transfers 2019-2021](https://github.com/gondiam/visualization_timeseries)
* Using highcharter library we develop a time-series visualization of UVI transfers of a region of Spain 
* It is an interactive way between periods and more than 20 bases
* A summary of different parameters per each base
* A boxplot to visualize the distribution of the records of transfers in general and per year
* Total number of transfers per year and base

# [Project 2: Churn customers prediction](https://github.com/gondiam/Churn_prediction)
* A Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to understand the data and to compare betwwen groups of population
* Comparing by graphs the two groups was performed too in case it was a real variable was performed a density and boxplot graph otherwise was performed a barplot
* The resampling and feature engineering was important due to the imbalance dataset
* At the end we use a XGboost model for classification and using gridsearch we improve the hyperparameter tune to improve the performance

# [Project 3: Bootcamp DPhi Gender Determination by Morphometry of Eyes](https://github.com/gondiam/gondiam/blob/main/bootcampdphi_def_GDA.py)
Problem Statement

The anthropometric analysis of the human face is an essential study for performing craniofacial plastic and reconstructive surgeries.
Facial anthropometrics are affected by various factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, environment, and region.  

Our objective is to build a model to scan the image of an eye of a patient and find if the gender of the patient is male or female.

For this problem a deep learning  model using tensorflow and keras with a result of 92.4512% of correct labeled images to the competition and being 37 out of 91.

# [Project 4: Forecast of Ethereum using LSTM Neural Network](https://github.com/gondiam/gondiam/blob/main/LSTM_loockback_1.ipynb)
Problem Statement

The variance of the price of the cryptocurrencies are one of the main problems

Our objective is forecast with precision into this time series problem

For this problem a powerful type of neural network designed to handle sequence dependence is called recurrent neural networks.
The Long Short-Term Memory network or LSTM network is a type of recurrent neural network used in deep learning because very large architectures can be successfully trained.

We have a result of 0.1 in the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) which measures the difference between the prediction and the real value.
